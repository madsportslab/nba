# Can the Boston Celtics Win It All This Season?

The Boston Celtics came off a strong season last year where this young group made the NBA Finals for the first time led primarily by the youthful and energetic Jayson Tatum and Jalen Brown, it seemed to me that the team was worn down going into the Finals after dismantling the championship Milwaukee Bucks and a very solid Miami Heat team, and they also faced an experienced behemoth in the Golden State Warriors that have won a handful of the championships in this decade.  Last year's roster is primarily in tact with the same top 8 rotation players: Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Al Horford, Robert Williams, Derrick White, Grant Williams, and Payton Pritchard.  They lost some size with the deparature of Daniel Theis, but made up for it with a couple acquisitions, Danilo Gallinari and Blake Griffin.  Unfortunately Gallinari is out for the rest of the season after tearing his ACL for team Italy and Blake Griffin is just a shell of his former self, but one of the best acquisitions for Boston has been the addition of Malcom Brogdon.  Brogdon although has a long history of significant injuries, is an all around player that can pass, shoot, drive, and defend, his offense is surprisingly solid, he can shoot from deep, at 6 foot 5 inches, he can also cause a lot of trouble on the defensive end.

The Celtics thus far have primarily used Brogdon as a backup to Tatum, but I feel that they need to put him into the starting lineup at some point, Tatum, Brown, Robert Williams III, Smart, and Brogdon, that is the death lineup for Boston, all can shoot from distance aside from Williams, but from a defensive perspective, this team will clamp down on anyone.  This is about as close as you can get to Golden State's death lineup for their 2018 Championship roster with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala, the only difference being that Smart is not as good an offensive player as Iguodala, swap in Horford for Williams and you're a little bit closer in terms of scoring, but defense is slightly reduced.  I'm not sure why the coaching staff for Boston is putting Brogdon as backup, but I sense that it's because of his previous injuries, they're trying to keep him fresh for the playoffs, if their reasoning is more so to spread out the scorers so that the bench squad still has someone that can drive the offense, I think this would be a true shame.  Typically teams don't swap out all 5 players at a time, 2-3 players at most, so there will be some mixing, but I think Brogdon needs more time with Brown and Tatum, that's the only way that they'll get ready for the playoffs, Brown and Tatum have played with each other for the past several seasons, they know each other's moves, Brogdon is the new kid on the block and needs more time to get to the top of the rotation where he truly belongs and for Tatum and Brown to understand how to leverage this type of talented player on similar levels with those two.

From an eastern conference perspective, the main challengers to Boston's supremecy would be from the Milwaukee Bucks, Brooklyn Nets, and possibly the Philadelphia Sixers.  Milwaukee will be a huge threat if Kris Middleton comes back healthy soon, they also added Joe Ingles who's a solid player all around, this would probably be the one team that would be hard to stop for Boston, playing without Middleton last year forced 7 games with the Bucks.

The Brooklyn Nets are becoming a scary team with Ben Simmons and Joe Harris back healthy, Durant and Irving playing well, and the additions of Royce O'Neale and TJ Warren, this is a team that could also match up well with Boston, this team can go 10 deep with Durant, Irving, Claxton, Harris, Simmons, O'Neale, Warren, Curry, Morris Jr, Mills, there's a mix of championship experience, but the one thing that the Nets are lacking is good defense, Simmons helps improve the defense, but two of the 5 starters can't really clamp down in Durant and Irving, so the edge goes to Boston.

The Sixers are not as good as the Bucks or Nets, but could provide matchup problems with Embiid, the Sixers also lack the defense, especially around the perimeter, Harden, Tobias Harris, Tyrese Maxey are not really lock down defenders, Embiid and P.J. Tucker are definitely top defenders so that leaves them vulnerable on the perimeter, inside the paint Embiid dominates, but he's only one person, so if the Celtics' perimeter shots are not falling, they could be defeated quite handily, but I don't expect that to be the case for 4 games in a 7 game series.

For the western conference, I see a few teams with the potential to get to the Finals and this really depends on the health of the respective teams, but the Memphis Grizzlies, New Orleans Pelicans, Golden State Warriors, and Los Angeles Clippers all have chances to reach the Finals, the Phoenix Suns have drifted out of contention, it seems that every year that Chris Paul's contract is about to expire, he plays some of his best basketball, after he signs an extension, the next years are filled with mediocrity and injury, this year, Paul is non-existent and without him, the Phoenix Suns are mediocre, in fact they're less than mediocre at tenth place in the western conference at the moment, so I did not include them.

Golden State being last years champions, really didn't change their rotation aside from Gary Payton II, he was actually a pretty good bench defensive player, brought in the intensity similar to Iguodala, but not at quite the same level, but that's missing in this year's squad.  Curry, Thompson, Poole are deficits on defense, there are not many players any of these three can lockdown in the NBA, but that's why they have players like Draymond Green, Andre Wiggins, and Kevin Looney.  If the Celtics go head to head with Golden State this year, I think the Warriors would probably get beat in six.

The Grizzlies and Pelicans are up and coming teams with really no championship or even Finals experience, but they have some really exciting young players that could make some damage.  The Grizzlies are surprisingly good at the first six spots: Ja Morant, Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Jaren Jackson Jr, Adams, and Danny Green, beyond that they start to thin out with Tyus Jones and Brandon Clarke, but they're decent players, just little playoff experience.

The Pelicans are somewhat of an x-factor, they don't have the championship experience, but they are deep, athletic, and well coached, Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Trey Murphy III, Jonas Valanciunas, Herbert Jones, Jose Alvarado, Naji Marshall, and Devonte Graham, they can go 9 deep, if you add in Larry Nance Jr and if I squint, Jaxon Hayes, that's 11 strong.  It all really depends on the health of the team, Zion is pretty much unstoppable, I don't even know if Robert Williams III could stop him consistently, maybe Horford, but the amount of girth that Williamson brings, I doubt they could really hold up.  I think offense isn't a problem for the Pelicans, it's more so the defense and being able to hold Tatum, Brown, and Brogdon down, that's the questionable part.

The Clippers are the final y-factor, any team with a healthy Kawhi Leonard is a championship contending team, put him on the Charlotte Hornets and they'd probably have a chance to get to the Finals.  There are many holes in the roster at the moment, but this team could put some match up problems against Boston, the Clippers could lock down Tatum, Brown, and Brogdon with a Leonard, Paul George, Marcus Morris, Sr combo, but at the end of the day, it would come down to depth, that's where the Clippers have the disadvantage: Norman Powell, Terance Mann, Robert Covington, and Ivica Zubac let them go seven deep at best, if they have to battle 3 monstrous teams to get to the Finals, they won't have any gas left in the tank for Boston.

Overall, if the Celtics remain healthy, I feel it will be a rematch of last year's Finals with the Warriors tearing back to the top three of the western conference, but this time without Payton, and with Boston improving the roster, the Celtics are going to win it all this year.
